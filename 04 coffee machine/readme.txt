If the resources available for the given order is not sufficient machine will throw an error, else it'll go to the payment option
The customer may place an order and provide coins in the following denominations: pennies, quarters, dimes, and nickels. The machine will make coffee if the entered amount is sufficient, but it will return the change if it is not
Now the order is served and the change will be returned and now the machine is ready to serve the next customer
