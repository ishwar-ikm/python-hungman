This is Guess The Indian State Game. In this perticular game the user has to guess the name of the indian state. When the user correctly guesses the state, the state's name appears over the corresponding state in the map. This process is repeated if the user guesses the incorrect state name or if they have already guessed the state name. When the user has correctly guessed all 28 states, the game ends with a congratulations message. This game is inspired from the website called sporcle (https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/indiastates).
