There are 5 programs which I did on the way to learn Turtle module

01_dashed_line: A simple program in which our turtle draws a dashed lines for 300 spaces

02_shape: Starts by drawing a triangle and ends by drawing a decagon on the same base but with different random colors, sides of all the polygon is 100 spaces

03_random_walk: Each time turtle is randomly headed to a direction and moves 30 spaces. This process continues for 200 times

04_spirograph: A program to create a spirograph, which consists of 72 circles

05_hirst_painting: This program recreates the famous hirst painting (https://www.phillips.com/detail/damien-hirst/UK010616/20) using turtle. I first used hirst_img.jpg to extract the color used in the painting using colorgram and then used the list of those colors to random draw dots using turtle.

06_etch_a_sketch: We have an arrow which moves accoring to the keyboard input and draw lines along the way. W to  move forwards, S to move backwards, A to turn left, D to turn righta and Spacebar resets back to the orginal position
