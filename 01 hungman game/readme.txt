Hungman is my first python project that I uploaded on github
This is a word guessing game. You have six chances to guess the word alphabet by alphabet, and each of your six chances is symbolized by a hungman.
You will lose the game if your hungman's figure is complete, but if you are able to guess the word before then you will win.
